# Hi there
This website presents some of my open-source coding projects.
Some information about myself [here](http://carlosgomes.ch)

## Projects
* [OpenMapper](https://github.com/OpenMapper)
  + You can install it on [ubuntu as snap](https://uappexplorer.com/snap/ubuntu/openmapper-desktop)
* Some examples on how to use some tools such as Unit Tests C++ using cmake
  + [C++ Unit Tests](https://github.com/gocarlos/unit_tests_example) with [Gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
  + [ROS Unit Tests](https://github.com/gocarlos/ros_unit_tests_example)
* Example of a [Python3 app](https://github.com/gocarlos/python-ubuntu-snap-app-example), which is released as [snap package to the ubuntu store](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/gocarlos/python-ubuntu-snap-app-example). It was unit tests and code coverage --> good point to start if one wants to build a python app for linux.
* A linux app called [traffic monitor](https://github.com/vigilatore/traffic_monitor) capable of counting the amount of cars passing on a street. It uses computer vision to achieve that. This app is also released as snap app in the snap store. 

* Other projects coming soon.
